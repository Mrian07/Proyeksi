# ProyeksiApp 4.0.7

ProyeksiApp 4.0.7 has been released which contains important security
and bug fixes.

We advise everyone to update their ProyeksiApp installation.

In the previous ProyeksiApp version it was possible to see some work
package information without authorization. This error has been fixed
with ProyeksiApp 4.0.7.

Additionally, several errors on the work package list have been fixed:

  - Deleted work package queries which have been added to the side menu
    are now properly removed when the query is deleted
    ([\#18591](https://community.proyeksi.id/work_packages/18591 "#18591")).
  - The “Save” button in the query list is now only displayed when
    changes have been made
    ([\#18592](https://community.proyeksi.id/work_packages/18592 "#18592")).

Furthermore, a bug has been fixed which caused an internal error when
creating a new reporting
([\#18593](https://community.proyeksi.id/work_packages/18593 "#18593"))
and an error related to the grouping of timelines has been addressed
([\#18690](https://community.proyeksi.id/work_packages/18690 "#18690")).

To get an overview of the new version, please refer to the [Changelog
v.4.0.7](https://community.proyeksi.id/versions/602 "Changelog v.4.0.7") or
