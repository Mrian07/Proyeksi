# Integrations

If you have previously worked with other tools and want to switch or need an integration to ProyeksiApp, there is a way to do so for some applications.

## GitHub

ProyeksiApp offers a basic GitHub integration. You will find more information about the GitHub integration in our [GitHub integration guideline](../../system-admin-guide/github-integration/).

## Gitlab

The GitLab integration to ProyeksiApp is still in development and you can find all information [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15847).


## Jira

Currently, there is no direct integration between ProyeksiApp and Jira. Since ProyeksiApp is an excellent open source alternative to Jira, we have prepared a way to import tickets from Jira to ProyeksiApp. First, you can export your tasks from Jira into an Excel file and then import these tasks via an [Excel plugin into ProyeksiApp](./excel-synchronization).

If you would like to learn more about the features of **ProyeksiApp vs Jira** please read [here](https://www.proyeksi.id/blog/open-source-jira-alternative/).

## Microsoft Project

There is an integration between MS Project and ProyeksiApp. However, the synch plugin is not actively maintained at this time. If you wish to find out more, please [contact us](https://www.proyeksi.id/contact-us/).
To synchronize tasks from MS Project to ProyeksiApp, you can export your MS Project file to Excel and then [synchronize it with ProyeksiApp]( ./excel-synchronization).

## Trello

Currently, there is no direct integration between ProyeksiApp and Trello. To synchronize tasks from Trello to ProyeksiApp, export your tasks from Trello into an Excel file and then import these tasks via an [Excel plugin into ProyeksiApp](./excel-synchronization).

If you would like to learn more about ProyeksiApp's features vs Trello, please read [here](https://www.proyeksi.id/blog/trello-alternative/).

## Toggl

We do offer an integration between ProyeksiApp and the time tracking app Toggl. Find out more [here](../time-and-costs/time-tracking/toggl-integration/).

## Slack

There is a rudimentary ProyeksiApp Slack integration. It messages a configured Slack channel, every time a Work Package or Wiki site is modified. This integration is not officially supported by ProyeksiApp.
To activate it in the Enterprise cloud please [get in touch](https://www.proyeksi.id/contact-us/). For the Enterprise on-premises edition and the Community Edition you can find the plugin and its documentation on GitHub: [ProyeksiApp Slack plugin](https://github.com/opf/proyeksiapp-slack#proyeksiapp-slack-plugin) 

## Timesheet
Currently, there is no direct integration between ProyeksiApp and Timesheet. If you are looking for a time tracking tool with a simple push of a button, consider the integration with [Toggl](../time-and-costs/time-tracking/toggl-integration/).

## Mattermost

There is a user-provided integration with Mattermost. Please note that it is not officially supported and that we do not take any liability when you use it. You can find it [here](https://github.com/girish17/op-mattermost).
